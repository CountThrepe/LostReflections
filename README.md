I reached out to two friends and initiated this project. One did all the visual art and one did all the sfx and music. I assembled everything in Unity and developed all the code for player combat, enemy AI, environment interaction, background parallax, changing soundscapes, camera follow, etc. I did 100% of the level design, and was the main creative lead for the overall game design, though that was much more collaborative. I also managed our team, giving out tasks and setting goals for both of my friends.

Community feedback from other jammers has been very positive as of one week into voting (2/26/21).

This jam was a ton of fun, and I would like to do more game development going forward. I think my next project might be something in VR with an Oculus Rift S headset.
